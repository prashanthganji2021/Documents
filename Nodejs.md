**Node Js**
- A. Node Js is a single-threaded, non-blocking, asynchronous programming language that is used to develop server-side applications. It is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment that is used to execute JavaScript code on the server-side. Node Js is built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. 


 **What is meant by single-threaded?**
- Single-threaded means that Node Js can handle only one request at a time.
- It uses a single thread to handle all the requests. 

**How does Node Js handle multiple requests?**
- Node Js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model to handle multiple requests.
- It uses an event loop to handle multiple requests.
- The event loop is a mechanism that allows Node Js to handle multiple requests without blocking the execution of the program.
- When a request is received, Node Js adds it to the event loop and continues to process other requests.
- When the request is completed, Node Js sends the response back to the client.

**what is mean by  event loop in Node Js?**
- The event loop is a mechanism that allows Node Js to handle multiple requests without blocking the execution of the program.
- It is a loop that continuously checks for new events and executes the corresponding callback functions.
- The event loop is responsible for handling I/O operations, timers, and other asynchronous operations in Node Js.
example of event loop in Node Js:
```javascript
setInterval(() => {
  console.log('Hello World');
}, 1000);
```
- In this example, the setInterval function is used to print 'Hello World' every second.
- The event loop continuously checks for new events and executes the callback function every second.

**What is meant by non-blocking I/O?**
- Non-blocking I/O means that Node Js does not wait for I/O operations to complete before moving on to the next operation.
- It allows Node Js to handle multiple requests simultaneously without blocking the execution of the program.
- Node Js uses callbacks and promises to handle asynchronous operations.


**What is meant by asynchronous programming?**
- Asynchronous programming means that Node Js can execute multiple operations simultaneously without blocking the execution of the program.
- It allows Node Js to handle I/O operations, timers, and other asynchronous operations without waiting for them to complete.
- Asynchronous programming is achieved using callbacks, promises, and async/await in Node Js.

**What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous programming?**
- Synchronous programming means that the program executes one operation at a time in a sequential order.
- Asynchronous programming means that the program can execute multiple operations simultaneously without waiting for them to complete.
- Synchronous programming blocks the execution of the program until the operation is completed.
- Asynchronous programming allows the program to continue executing other operations while waiting for the asynchronous operation to complete.

**What are the advantages of Node Js?**
- Fast execution: Node Js is built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, which compiles JavaScript code into machine code, making it faster than other programming languages.

- The crypto module in Node Js is used to provide cryptographic functionality.
- It provides a set of cryptographic functions that can be used to encrypt and decrypt data, generate hashes, and create digital signatures.
- The crypto module is used to secure data and protect it from unauthorized access.

**Other then JWT what can be used for authentication in Node Js?**
- Other than JWT, session-based authentication can be used for authentication in Node Js.
- Session-based authentication uses a session ID to authenticate users.
- When a user logs in, a session ID is generated and stored in a session store.
- The session ID is sent to the client, and the client sends the session ID with each request.

**How to limit the number of requests from same IP in Node Js?**
- To limit the number of requests from the same IP in Node Js, you can use the rate-limiting middleware.
- The rate-limiting middleware can be used to limit the number of requests from the same IP address within a specified time frame.
- The rate-limiting middleware can be configured to limit the number of requests per IP address, per route, or per application.
```javascript
import rateLimit from 'express-rate-limit';

export const rateLimiterUsingThirdParty = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000, // 24 hrs in milliseconds
  max: 100,
  message: 'You have exceeded the 100 requests in 24 hrs limit!', 
  standardHeaders: true,
  legacyHeaders: false,
});
export { rateLimiterUsingThirdParty } from './rateLimiter';
app.use(rateLimiterUsingThirdParty)
```

**How can you avoid callback hells?**
- Callback hell is a situation where multiple nested callbacks are used in a program, making the code difficult to read and maintain.
example of callback hell:
```javascript
fs.readFile('file1.txt', (err, data) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error(err);
  } else {
    fs.readFile('file2.txt', (err, data) => {
      if (err) {
        console.error(err);
      } else {
        fs.readFile('file3.txt', (err, data) => {
          if (err) {
            console.error(err);
          } else {
            console.log(data);
          }
        });
      }
    });
  }
});
```

- To avoid callback hell, you can use promises or async/await in Node Js.
example of using promises:

**When are background or worker processes useful?**
- Background or worker processes are useful when you need to perform long-running or CPU-intensive tasks in Node Js.
- like RabbitMQ, Redis, and ZeroMQ can be used to implement background or worker processes in Node Js. to handle tasks such as sending emails, processing images, or generating reports.


**Name the types of API functions in Node?**
- There are four types of API functions in Node Js:
1. Asynchronous, non-blocking functions: These functions do not block the execution of the program and return immediately.
2. Synchronous, blocking functions: These functions block the execution of the program until the operation is completed.
3. Asynchronous, blocking functions: These functions block the execution of the program but return immediately.
4. Synchronous, non-blocking functions: These functions do not block the execution of the program but return immediately.


**Explain chaining in Nodejs?**
- Chaining in Node Js is a technique used to execute multiple asynchronous operations in a sequential order.
- It allows you to chain multiple asynchronous operations together and execute them one after the other.
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

fs.readFile('file1.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error(err);
  } else {
    console.log(data);
    fs.readFile('file2.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
      if (err) {
        console.error(err);
      } else {
        console.log(data);
      }
    });
  }
});
```

### Basic SQL Injection Concepts (1-20)
1. What is SQL injection?
   - SQL injection is a type of cyber attack where malicious SQL statements are inserted into an input field, allowing attackers to manipulate the database backend.
2. How can SQL injection be prevented?
   - Using parameterized queries or prepared statements can prevent SQL injection by separating SQL code from user input.
3. What are the dangers of SQL injection attacks?
   - SQL injection attacks can lead to data loss, unauthorized access to sensitive information, and potential damage to the database structure.
4. Provide an example of a simple SQL injection attack.
   - Example: Suppose an attacker enters `' OR 1=1; --` into a login form's username field to bypass authentication.
5. How do you identify and test for SQL injection vulnerabilities?
   - By inputting special characters or SQL syntax into input fields and observing the application's response, you can test for SQL injection vulnerabilities.
6. Explain the role of sanitization and validation in preventing SQL injection.
   - Sanitization removes or escapes potentially harmful characters from user input, while validation checks input against predefined rules to ensure it's safe for processing.
7. What are the common methods used by attackers in SQL injection attacks?
   - Attackers often use techniques like union-based injection, error-based injection, blind injection, and time-based injection to exploit SQL vulnerabilities.
8. How do you securely handle user input in SQL queries?
   - By using parameterized queries or prepared statements, you can safely include user input in SQL queries without risking SQL injection vulnerabilities.
9. What are the consequences of a successful SQL injection attack?
   - Consequences include data leakage, unauthorized access, data manipulation, and potentially severe damage to the database and application.
10. How do you prevent SQL injection in dynamic SQL queries?
    - By using stored procedures or ORM frameworks, you can reduce the risk of SQL injection in dynamic SQL queries.

### Intermediate SQL Injection Techniques (21-40)
21. What is a blind SQL injection attack?

 CHAPTER 1: Introduction to Node.js
    
   Before Knowing Node.js, Let's Understand What is single-threaded and multi-threaded why it used where it used and how it works . 

   terms tread and process are used in the context of programming and operating systems. 
   A process is an instance of a computer program that is being executed. 
   A thread is the smallest unit of execution within a process. 
   A process can have multiple threads. Threads share the same memory space, while processes have separate memory spaces.
    Single-threaded and multi-threaded are terms used to describe how a program or process operates.

    Single-threaded: A single-threaded program or process can only perform one task at a time. It follows a sequential execution model, where tasks are completed one after the other. If a task takes a long time to complete, it can block the execution of other tasks.
    example in code 
    ```javascript
    function task1() {
      console.log('Task 1 started');
      setTimeout(() => {
        console.log('Task 1 completed');
      }, 2000);
    }

    function task2() {
      console.log('Task 2 started');
      setTimeout(() => {
        console.log('Task 2 completed');
      }, 1000);
    }

    task1();
    task2();
    ```
    In this example, task1 and task2 are executed sequentially to demonstrate single-threaded behavior. Task 1 takes longer to complete than Task 2, but Task 2 has to wait for Task 1 to finish before it can start.



    Multi-threaded: A multi-threaded program or process can perform multiple tasks concurrently. Each thread can execute independently, allowing for parallel processing and improved performance. Threads can share resources and communicate with each other.

    example in code 
    ```javascript
    const { Worker, isMainThread, parentPort } = require('worker_threads');
    
    if (isMainThread) {
      console.log('Main thread started');
    
      const worker1 = new Worker(__filename);
      const worker2 = new Worker(__filename);
    
      worker1.on('message', (msg) => {
        console.log(`Worker 1: ${msg}`);
      });
    
      worker2.on('message', (msg) => {
        console.log(`Worker 2: ${msg}`);
      });
    
      worker1.postMessage('Task 1');
      worker2.postMessage('Task 2');
    } else {
      parentPort.postMessage('Task completed');
    }
    ```
    In this example, we use Node.js Worker Threads to create two worker threads that run concurrently. Each worker thread communicates with the main thread using messages.

    Node.js is a popular runtime environment for server-side JavaScript applications. It is built on the V8 JavaScript engine and uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient for handling concurrent operations.

    Key features of Node.js include:

    Asynchronous and event-driven: Node.js uses asynchronous programming to handle I/O operations without blocking the execution of other tasks. It uses events and callbacks to notify the completion of operations.

    Single-threaded and non-blocking: Node.js is single-threaded, but it can support multiple concurrent operations through event loops and callbacks. This allows it to handle high levels of concurrency efficiently.

    CommonJS modules: Node.js uses the CommonJS module system to organize and load modules. Modules are reusable pieces of code that can be shared across different parts of an application.

    npm ecosystem: Node.js has a rich ecosystem of open-source libraries and packages available through the npm (Node Package Manager) registry. Developers can easily install and manage dependencies for their projects.

    Cross-platform: Node.js is cross-platform and runs on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. This makes it a versatile choice for developing applications that need to run on different environments.

    Node.js is commonly used for building web servers, APIs, real-time applications, and microservices. It is well-suited for applications that require high performance, scalability, and real-time data processing.

    In the next chapter, we will explore the core concepts of Node.js, including modules, event-driven programming, and asynchronous operations.

    CHAPTER 2: Core Concepts of Node.js

    Node.js is built on several core concepts that define its architecture and behavior. Understanding these concepts is essential for developing efficient and scalable applications with Node.js.

    1. Modules: Node.js uses the CommonJS module system to organize code into reusable modules. Each file in a Node.js application is treated as a module, and modules can export functions, objects, or values for use in other modules. Modules can be loaded using the require function and exported using the module.exports or exports objects.

    Example of a module in Node.js:
    ```javascript
    // math.js
    function add(a, b) {
      return a + b;
    }

    function subtract(a, b) {
      return a - b;
    }

    module.exports = { add, subtract };
    ```
    In this example, the math.js module exports two functions, add and subtract, using the module.exports object.

    Modules can be loaded and used in other modules as follows:
    ```javascript
    // app.js
    const math = require('./math');

    console.log(math.add(2, 3)); // Output: 5
    console.log(math.subtract(5, 2)); // Output: 3
    ```
    In this example, the math module is loaded using the require function, and its functions are used in the app.js module.

    2. Event-driven programming: Node.js uses an event-driven architecture to handle asynchronous operations. It uses events, event emitters, and event listeners to manage the flow of control in an application. When an asynchronous operation completes, an event is emitted, and any registered event listeners are notified.

    Example of event-driven programming in Node.js:
    ```javascript
    const EventEmitter = require('events');

    class MyEmitter extends EventEmitter {}

    const myEmitter = new MyEmitter();

    myEmitter.on('event', () => {
      console.log('Event occurred');
    });

    myEmitter.emit('event'); // Output: Event occurred
    ```

    In this example, an event emitter is created using the EventEmitter class. An event listener is registered for the 'event' event, and the event is emitted using the emit method.

    3. Asynchronous operations: Node.js is designed to handle asynchronous operations efficiently. It uses non-blocking I/O operations and callbacks to perform tasks without waiting for the completion of previous operations. This allows Node.js to handle multiple concurrent operations and maintain high performance.

    Example of asynchronous operations in Node.js:
    ```javascript
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log('Timeout completed');
    }, 2000);

    console.log('Async operation started');
    ```
    In this example, the setTimeout function is used to delay the execution of a callback function by 2 seconds. The console.log statement after setTimeout is executed immediately, demonstrating the non-blocking behavior of Node.js.

    4. Callbacks: Callbacks are a fundamental concept in Node.js for handling asynchronous operations. A callback is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed when the operation completes. Callbacks are used to handle the results of asynchronous operations and perform additional tasks.

    Example of callbacks in Node.js:
    ```javascript
    function fetchData(callback) {
      setTimeout(() => {
        const data = 'Data fetched';
        callback(data);
      }, 2000);
    }

    fetchData((data) => {
      console.log(data); // Output: Data fetched
    });
    ```
    In this example, the fetchData function accepts a callback function as an argument and calls it with the fetched data after a delay of 2 seconds.

    5. Streams: Streams are used in Node.js to handle data flow and I/O operations efficiently. Streams allow data to be read or written in chunks, reducing memory usage and improving performance. There are different types of streams in Node.js, such as Readable, Writable, Duplex, and Transform streams.

    Example of streams in Node.js:
    ```javascript
    const fs = require('fs');

    const read
    stream = fs.createReadStream('input.txt');
    const writeStream = fs.createWriteStream('output.txt');

    readStream.pipe(writeStream);
    ```
    In this example, a Readable stream is created to read data from the input.txt file, and a Writable stream is created to write data to the output.txt file. The pipe method is used to transfer data from the Readable stream to the Writable stream.

    6. Error handling: Node.js uses error-first callbacks to handle errors in asynchronous operations. Error-first callbacks have a standard signature where the first argument is reserved for an error object, and subsequent arguments contain the result of the operation. Developers can check for errors in the callback function and handle them appropriately.

    Example of error handling in Node.js:
    ```javascript
    function fetchData(callback) {
      setTimeout(() => {
        const error = null;
        const data = 'Data fetched';
        callback(error, data);
      }, 2000);
    }

    fetchData((error, data) => {
      if (error) {
        console.error('Error:', error);
      } else {
        console.log(data);
      }
    });
    ```
    In this example, the fetchData function returns an error object along with the fetched data. The callback function checks for errors and logs them if present.

    These core concepts form the foundation of Node.js and are essential for building efficient and scalable applications. In the next chapter, we will explore the Node.js runtime environment and its key components.

    CHAPTER 3: Node.js Runtime Environment

    The Node.js runtime environment provides the infrastructure for running JavaScript applications outside the browser. It includes the V8 JavaScript engine, libuv library, and other components that enable Node.js to execute JavaScript code efficiently.

    Key components of the Node.js runtime environment include:

    1. V8 JavaScript engine: The V8 JavaScript engine is an open-source JavaScript engine developed by Google for the Chrome browser. It compiles JavaScript code into machine code for faster execution. Node.js uses the V8 engine as its runtime to execute JavaScript code on the server-side.

    2. libuv library: The libuv library is a cross-platform library that provides asynchronous I/O operations, event loops, and other features for handling concurrency in Node.js. It abstracts platform-specific details and provides a consistent API for working with file systems, networking, and other I/O operations.

    3. Event loop: The event loop is a key component of the Node.js runtime environment that manages asynchronous operations and event-driven programming. It allows Node.js to handle multiple concurrent operations efficiently by processing events in a non-blocking manner.

    4. Modules: Node.js uses the CommonJS module system to organize code into reusable modules. Modules are loaded using the require function and can export functions, objects, or values for use in other modules. Node.js provides built-in modules for common tasks, such as file system operations, networking, and HTTP servers.

    5. npm (Node Package Manager): npm is the official package manager for Node.js and provides access to a vast ecosystem of open-source libraries and packages. Developers can use npm to install, manage, and publish packages for their Node.js applications. npm simplifies dependency management and allows developers to reuse code across projects.

    6. REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop): The Node.js REPL is an interactive shell that allows developers to experiment with JavaScript code, test snippets, and evaluate expressions. It provides a quick way to prototype code, debug issues, and explore the features of Node.js.

    7. Buffer: The Buffer class in Node.js is used to handle binary data, such as reading from files, working with streams, and encoding/decoding data. Buffers are allocated memory blocks that can store raw binary data and are commonly used in I/O operations.

    8. Global objects: Node.js provides global objects that are available in all modules and can be accessed without requiring them explicitly. Examples of global objects include console, process, and global.

    9. Process: The process object in Node.js provides information about the current Node.js process, such as environment variables, command-line arguments, and exit codes. It also allows developers to interact with the process, handle signals, and manage child processes.

    10. Error handling: Node.js uses error-first callbacks to handle errors in asynchronous operations. Error-first callbacks have a standard signature where the first argument is reserved for an error object, and subsequent arguments contain the result of the operation. Developers can check for errors in the callback function and handle them appropriately.

    Understanding the Node.js runtime environment and its key components is essential for developing efficient and scalable applications. In the next chapter, we will explore the Node.js event-driven architecture and its impact on application development.

    CHAPTER 4: Event-Driven Architecture in Node.js

    Node.js uses an event-driven architecture to handle asynchronous operations and manage the flow of control in applications. This architecture is based on events, event emitters, and event listeners that allow developers to build scalable and efficient applications.

    Key concepts of event-driven architecture in Node.js include:

    1. Events: Events are signals that indicate that a specific action or operation has occurred. In Node.js, events are represented by strings that describe the type of event, such as 'click', 'open', or 'data'. Events can be emitted by event emitters and listened to by event listeners.

    2. Event emitters: Event emitters are objects that can emit events and notify registered event listeners when an event occurs. In Node.js, event emitters are instances of the EventEmitter class from the events module. Developers can create custom event emitters and emit events using the emit method.

    3. Event listeners: Event listeners are functions that are registered to listen for specific events emitted by event emitters. When an event is emitted, all registered event listeners for that event are called with the event data. Event listeners can perform tasks based on the event data and respond to events in the application.

    4. Event loop: The event loop is a key component of the Node.js runtime environment that manages asynchronous operations and event-driven programming. It allows Node.js to handle multiple concurrent operations efficiently by processing events in a non-blocking manner. The event loop continuously checks for events and executes event listeners when events occur.

    5. Callbacks: Callbacks are a fundamental concept in Node.js for handling asynchronous operations. A callback is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed when the operation completes. Callbacks are used to handle the results of asynchronous operations and perform additional tasks.

    6. Asynchronous operations: Node.js is designed to handle asynchronous operations efficiently. It uses non-blocking I/O operations and callbacks to perform tasks without waiting for the completion of previous operations. This allows Node.js to handle multiple concurrent operations and maintain high performance.

    7. Error handling: Node.js uses error-first callbacks to handle errors in asynchronous operations. Error-first callbacks have a standard signature where the first argument is reserved for an error object, and subsequent arguments contain the result of the operation. Developers can check for errors in the callback function and handle them appropriately.

    By leveraging the event-driven architecture of Node.js, developers can build scalable and responsive applications that can handle high levels of concurrency and perform efficiently. In the next chapter, we will explore the Node.js file system module and its capabilities.
