# interview Questions  with short answers
## Concept:1. Arrow Functions
Q1. What are arrow functions in JavaScript?
A1. Arrow functions are a new way to write anonymous function expressions in JavaScript. They are more concise and easier to read than traditional function expressions.

Q2. What are the benefits of using arrow functions?
A2. Arrow functions have a shorter syntax, do not have their own this, arguments, super, or new.target, and are best suited for non-method functions.

Q3. How do you define an arrow function?
A3. An arrow function is defined using a pair of parentheses, an arrow, and a pair of curly braces. For example: (x, y) => { return x + y; }

Q4. What is the difference between a traditional function and an arrow function?
A4. Arrow functions do not have their own this, arguments, super, or new.target, and have a shorter syntax than traditional functions.

Q5. Can arrow functions be used as methods on objects?
A5. No, arrow functions do not have their own this, so they are not suitable for use as methods on objects.

Q6. What is the syntax for an arrow function with a single parameter?
A6. An arrow function with a single parameter can be written without parentheses. For example: x => { return x * x; }

Q7. What is the syntax for an arrow function with no parameters?
A7. An arrow function with no parameters is written using an empty pair of parentheses. For example: () => { return 'Hello, World!'; }

Q8. What is the syntax for an arrow function with multiple parameters?
A8. An arrow function with multiple parameters is written using a pair of parentheses. For example: (x, y) => { return x + y; }

Q9. Can arrow functions be used as constructors?
A9. No, arrow functions cannot be used as constructors because they do not have their own this.

Q10. What is the return value of an arrow function with a single expression?
A10. An arrow function with a single expression will automatically return the value of that expression without needing an explicit return statement.

Q11. What is the return value of an arrow function with multiple expressions?
A11. An arrow function with multiple expressions will return the value of the last expression, or undefined if there is no return statement.

Q12. Can arrow functions be used as event handlers?
A12. Yes, arrow functions can be used as event handlers, but they are not suitable for use as methods on objects.

Q13. What is the lexical scope of an arrow function?
A13. The lexical scope of an arrow function is the same as its surrounding code, which means it has access to the this value of the enclosing context.

## Concept:2. Destructuring
Q1. What is destructuring in JavaScript?
A1. Destructuring is a way to extract values from objects and arrays into distinct variables.

Q2. What is the syntax for object destructuring?
A2. Object destructuring uses a pair of curly braces to extract values from an object into distinct variables. For example: const { name, age } = person;

Q3. What is the syntax for array destructuring?
A3. Array destructuring uses a pair of square brackets to extract values from an array into distinct variables. For example: const [x, y] = coordinates;

Q4. What is the difference between object destructuring and array destructuring?
A4. Object destructuring extracts values from an object based on their property names, while array destructuring extracts values from an array based on their positions.

Q5. What happens if a property or element is missing during destructuring?
A5. If a property or element is missing during destructuring, the variable will be assigned the value undefined.

Q6. Can you provide default values during destructuring?
A6. Yes, default values can be provided during destructuring using the assignment operator. For example: const { name = 'Anonymous' } = person;

Q7. What is the syntax for nested destructuring?
A7. Nested destructuring uses a combination of object and array syntax to extract values from nested objects and arrays. For example: const { name, address: [street, city] } = person;

Q8. Can destructuring be used with rest parameters?
A8. Yes, destructuring can be used with rest parameters to collect remaining elements into a new array. For example: const [x, y, ...z] = numbers;

Q9. What is the syntax for renaming variables during destructuring?
A9. Variables can be renamed during destructuring using the colon operator. For example: const { name: fullName } = person;

Q10. Can destructuring be used with function parameters?
A10. Yes, destructuring can be used with function parameters to extract values from objects and arrays directly in the parameter list.

## Concept:3. Spread/Rest Operators
Q1. What are spread and rest operators in JavaScript?
A1. The spread operator (...) is used to spread elements of an iterable (like an array or object) into places where zero or more elements or properties are expected. The rest operator, also (...), is used in function arguments to create an array of an indefinite number of arguments.

Q2. How do you use the spread operator with arrays?
A2. The spread operator can be used to combine arrays, insert elements, or create copies. For example: let arr1 = [1, 2, 3]; let arr2 = [...arr1, 4, 5]; // arr2 is now [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Q3. How do you use the spread operator with objects?
A3. The spread operator can be used to create copies of objects, merge objects, or add new properties. For example: let obj1 = {a: 1, b: 2}; let obj2 = {...obj1, c: 3}; // obj2 is now {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3}

Q4. How do you use the rest operator in function arguments?
A4. The rest operator can be used in function arguments to create an array of an indefinite number of arguments. For example: function sum(...args) { return args.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0); }

Q5. What is the difference between the spread and rest operators?
A5. The spread operator is used to unpack elements from an iterable, while the rest operator is used to pack elements into an array.

## Concept:4. Classes
Q1. What are classes in JavaScript?
A1. Classes are a template for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to manipulate that data. Classes in JS are built on prototypes but also have some syntax and semantics that are not shared with ES5 class-like semantics.

Q2. How do you define a class in JavaScript?
A2. A class is defined using the 'class' keyword, followed by the name of the class and a pair of curly braces. For example: class MyClass { }

Q3. What is a constructor method in a class?
A3. The constructor method is a special method for creating and initializing an object created with a class. It can take any number of parameters.

Q4. How do you create an instance of a class?
A4. An instance of a class is created using the 'new' keyword, followed by the class name and a pair of parentheses. For example: let myInstance = new MyClass();

Q5. What are class methods?
A5. Class methods are functions defined on the class's prototype. They are the tasks that the class can perform.

Q6. What is inheritance in classes?
A6. Inheritance is a mechanism where you can to derive a class from another class for a hierarchy of classes that share a set of attributes and methods.

Q7. How do you use inheritance in JavaScript classes?
A7. Inheritance in JavaScript classes is achieved using the 'extends' keyword. For example: class ChildClass extends ParentClass { }

Q8. What are static methods in a class?
A8. Static methods are methods that are defined on the class itself, not on instances of the class. They're often used for utility functions.

## Concept:5. Promises
Q1. What are promises in JavaScript?
A1. A Promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. It serves as a link between the function executing the asynchronous operation and the functions that will consume the result of the operation.

Q2. What are the states of a promise?
A2. A Promise can be in one of three states: pending (the Promise's outcome hasn't yet been determined), fulfilled (the operation completed successfully), or rejected (the operation failed).

Q3. How do you create a promise?
A3. A Promise is created using the Promise constructor, which takes a callback function with two parameters: resolve and reject. For example: let myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => { });

Q4. How do you use the 'then' method with a promise?
A4. The 'then' method is used to schedule a callback to be run when the Promise is resolved. For example: myPromise.then(value => { console.log(value); });

Q5. How do you use the 'catch' method with a promise?
A5. The 'catch' method is used to schedule a callback to be run when the Promise is rejected. For example: myPromise.catch(reason => { console.error(reason); });

Q6. What is promise chaining?
A6. Promise chaining is a technique where the 'then' method returns a new Promise, allowing the 'then' methods to be chained together. The value returned from one promise is passed to the next.

Q7. What is the 'finally' method in a promise?
A7. The 'finally' method is used to schedule a callback to be run when the Promise is settled, regardless of whether it was fulfilled or rejected. For example: myPromise.finally(() => { console.log('Done'); });

Q8. How do you use the 'all' method with promises?
A8. The 'all' method is used when you have multiple promises and you want to wait until all of them are resolved. For example: Promise.all([promise1, promise2]).then(values => { console.log(values); });

Q9. How do you use the 'race' method with promises?
A9. The 'race' method is used when you have multiple promises and you want to get the result of the first promise that resolves or rejects. For example: Promise.race([promise1, promise2]).then(value => { console.log(value); });

Q10. What is the 'resolve' method in a promise?
A10. The 'resolve' method returns a Promise object that is resolved with a given value. If the value is a promise, that promise is returned; if the value is a thenable (i.e., has a "then" method), the returned promise will "follow" that thenable, adopting its eventual state.

Q11. What is the 'reject' method in a promise?
A11. The 'reject' method returns a Promise object that is rejected with a given reason.

## Concept:6. Async/Await

Q1. What are async/await in JavaScript?
A1. Async/await is a new way to write asynchronous code in JavaScript. It makes it easier to write and understand asynchronous code by using the 'async' and 'await' keywords.

Q2. What is the 'async' keyword used for?
A2. The 'async' keyword is used to define an asynchronous function, which returns a Promise. For example: async function myFunction() { }

Q3. What is the 'await' keyword used for?
A3. The 'await' keyword is used to pause the execution of an asynchronous function until a Promise is settled, and to resume the execution of the asynchronous function after the Promise is settled.

Q4. How do you use async/await with a Promise?
A4. You can use the 'await' keyword to pause the execution of an asynchronous function until a Promise is settled. For example: let value = await myPromise;

Q5. What happens when you use the 'await' keyword with a rejected Promise?
A5. If you use the 'await' keyword with a rejected Promise, the rejected value will be thrown as an exception, which can be caught using a 'try...catch' block.

Q6. What is the difference between using async/await and using Promises?
A6. Async/await is a more readable and concise way to write asynchronous code than using Promises. It makes asynchronous code look more like synchronous code.

Q7. Can you use async/await with the 'then' method?
A7. No, you cannot use async/await with the 'then' method. Async/await is used to write asynchronous code in a more synchronous style.

Q8. Can you use async/await with the 'catch' method?
A8. Yes, you can use async/await with the 'catch' method to catch rejected Promises. For example: try { let value = await myPromise; } catch (reason) { console.error(reason); }

Q9. What is the return value of an async function?
A9. An async function returns a Promise, which is resolved with the value returned by the async function, or rejected with an uncaught exception thrown by the async function.

Q10. Can you use async/await with the 'all' method?
A10. Yes, you can use async/await with the 'all' method to wait for multiple Promises to be settled. For example: let values = await Promise.all([promise1, promise2]);

## Concept:7. Higher-Order Functions

Q1. What are higher-order functions in JavaScript?
A1. Higher-order functions are functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions as their results. They are a powerful way to abstract and reuse code.
example: function higherOrderFunction(callback) { callback(); } 

Q2. What is a callback function?
A2. A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed after some operation has been completed.


Q3. How do you create a higher-order function?
A3. A higher-order function is created by defining a function that takes another function as an argument or returns a function as its result.

Q4. What is the purpose of a higher-order function?
A4. The purpose of a higher-order function is to abstract and reuse code by passing functions as arguments or returning functions as results.

Q5. What is a pure function?
A5. A pure function is a function that always returns the same result for the same arguments and has no side effects. It is a key concept in functional programming.

Q6. What is a first-class function?
A6. In JavaScript, functions are first-class citizens, which means they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned as values from other functions.

Q7. What is a closure?
A7. A closure is a function that has access to its own scope, the scope of the outer function, and the global scope. It is created every time a function is created.
example: 
function outerFunction() { 
let outerVariable = 'I am from the outer function'; 
function innerFunction() {
console.log(outerVariable); 
} 
return innerFunction; 
}  outerFunction()();
output: I am from the outer function


Q8. What is a curried function?
A8. A curried function is a function that takes multiple arguments one at a time, returning a new function with each argument until all the arguments have been provided.
example:  function multiply(a) { 
return function(b) { 
return a * b; 
};
} 
multiply(3)(4);


Q9. What is a memoized function?
A9. A memoized function is a function that caches the results of its computations, so that when the same inputs occur again, the result can be returned from the cache instead of recomputing it.
example: function memoize(func) { 
let cache = {}; 
return function(n) { 
if (n in cache) { 
return cache[n]; 
} else { 
let result = func(n); 
cache[n] = result; 
return result; 
} 
}; 
}

## Concept:8. Immutable Data Structures
Q1. What are immutable data structures?
A1. Immutable data structures are data structures whose values cannot be changed after they are created. Any operation on an immutable data structure returns a new data structure with the modified value.

Q2. What are the benefits of using immutable data structures?
A2. Immutable data structures are easier to reason about, are less error-prone, and can be shared across different parts of an application without the risk of unintended side effects.

Q3. What are some examples of immutable data structures?
A3. Some examples of immutable data structures include strings, numbers, booleans, and frozen objects in JavaScript.

Q4. How do you create an immutable array in JavaScript?
A4. You can create an immutable array in JavaScript using the 'concat' method, the 'spread' operator, or the 'slice' method to create a new array with the modified value.

Q5. How do you create an immutable object in JavaScript?
A5. You can create an immutable object in JavaScript using the 'Object.assign' method, the 'spread' operator, or the 'Object.freeze' method to create a new object with the modified value.

Q6. What is the difference between mutable and immutable data structures?
A6. Mutable data structures can be changed after they are created, while immutable data structures cannot be changed after they are created.

Q7. What is the difference between shallow and deep immutability?
A7. Shallow immutability means that the top-level of a data structure is immutable, but nested objects or arrays can still be mutable. Deep immutability means that the entire data structure is immutable, including all nested objects and arrays.

Q8. What are some libraries for working with immutable data structures in JavaScript?
A8. Some libraries for working with immutable data structures in JavaScript include Immutable.js, Immer, and Mori.

## Concept:9. Pure Functions

Q1. What are pure functions in JavaScript?
A1. Pure functions are functions that always return the same result for the same arguments and have no side effects. They are a key concept in functional programming.

Q2. What are the benefits of using pure functions?
A2. Pure functions are easier to reason about, are less error-prone, and can be memoized and cached for better performance.

Q3. What is a side effect in a function?
A3. A side effect is any change to the state of the program that is observable outside the function, such as modifying a global variable, logging to the console, or changing the DOM.

Q4. What is referential transparency?
A4. Referential transparency is a property of pure functions that allows any call to a function to be replaced with its return value without changing the program's behavior.

Q5. What is a higher-order pure function?
A5. A higher-order pure function is a pure function that takes other functions as arguments or returns functions as its result.

Q6. What is a higher-order impure function?
A6. A higher-order impure function is a function that takes other functions as arguments or returns functions as its result, but is not a pure function because it has side effects.

Q7. What is the difference between a pure function and an impure function?
A7. A pure function always returns the same result for the same arguments and has no side effects, while an impure function may have side effects or return different results for the same arguments.

Q8. What are some techniques for working with impure functions in a pure way?
A8. Some techniques for working with impure functions in a pure way include using higher-order functions, dependency injection, and monads.

## Concept:10. Static Typing

Q1. What is static typing in JavaScript?
A1. Static typing is a type system where the type of a variable is known at compile time, and it is enforced by the compiler.

Q2. What are the benefits of using static typing?
A2. Static typing can catch type errors at compile time, provide better tooling and autocompletion, and improve code readability and maintainability.

Q3. What are some popular static typing languages that compile to JavaScript?
A3. Some popular static typing languages that compile to JavaScript include TypeScript, Flow, and ReasonML.

Q4. What is TypeScript?
A4. TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language. It compiles to plain JavaScript and can be used in place of JavaScript for any project.

Q5. What is Flow?
A5. Flow is a static type checker for JavaScript that is developed by Facebook. It can be used to gradually add static typing to existing JavaScript codebases.

Q6. What is ReasonML?
A6. ReasonML is a statically typed language that is a syntax extension of JavaScript. It is developed by Facebook and can be compiled to highly optimized JavaScript.

Q7. What is the difference between static typing and dynamic typing?
A7. Static typing is a type system where the type of a variable is known at compile time, while dynamic typing is a type system where the type of a variable is determined at runtime.

Q8. What are some popular static typing features in TypeScript?
A8. Some popular static typing features in TypeScript include type annotations, interfaces, enums, generics, and union types.

Q9. What are some popular static typing features in Flow?
A9. Some popular static typing features in Flow include type annotations, type inference, type refinement, and type aliases.

Q10. What are some popular static typing features in ReasonML?
A10. Some popular static typing features in ReasonML include type annotations, type inference, polymorphic variants, and pattern matching.


## Concept:11. Interfaces

Q1. What are interfaces in TypeScript?
A1. Interfaces in TypeScript are a way to define the shape of an object. They can be used to define contracts within your code and to provide explicit names for complex types.

Q2. How do you define an interface in TypeScript?
A2. An interface is defined using the 'interface' keyword, followed by the name of the interface and a pair of curly braces. For example: interface Person { name: string; age: number; }

Q3. What is the purpose of an interface?
A3. The purpose of an interface is to define a contract for an object, specifying the properties and methods that the object must have.

Q4. How do you use an interface in TypeScript?
A4. You can use an interface to define the shape of an object, and then use that interface as the type for variables, function parameters, and return values.

Q5. What is the difference between an interface and a type in TypeScript?
A5. An interface is a way to define the shape of an object, while a type is a way to define a custom type. Interfaces are open-ended and can be extended, while types are closed and cannot be extended.

Q6. Can an interface have optional properties?
